# MorseCode_EncoderDecoder
This project aims to implement Morse code communication using Arduino, enabling users to send and receive messages through light or sound, and facilitating communication for individuals with disabilities.

The Morse code encoder takes input using the keyboard in English and converts it to Morse code.
The converted morse code can be seen on the serial monitor, heard as beeps using the buzzer and
signalled using a blinking LED.

The Morse code decoder takes input using a button, a longer press represents a dash whereas a
short one is for a dot. The LED blinks when we feed in the input in morse code. The converted
code in English is visible on the Serial monitor.

It can be used as an efficient medium of communication by the deaf,blind and dumb.
Furthermore, we can use it to send and receive encrypted messages.
The codes are uploaded and compiled on the Arduino software. The microcontroller used is the
Arduino UNO R3. The breadboard facilitates in making circuit connections

The following are the objectives of this project:

1. To send the Morse code to Arduino using the keys and see the result as text in the Serial
Monitor.

3. To type our desired word or text and receive it in Morse code, so that we can send it as
light or sound.

5. To effectively use Morse code to facilitate communication for the mute,deaf and blind
